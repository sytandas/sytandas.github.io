title:  "YouTube Distraction Free (make it intentional)
"

We all have love and hate relationship with YouTube, sometimes it is a great problem solver, sometime it is a great teacher, sometimes it make up unwind and relax with some awesome content that can be challenge the main stream movies also. But there are some  big caveat  while using YouTube. Even one of my favourite channel 3brown1blue creator Grant Sanderson once said on his video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agbh95KyWxY (time stamp 09:00 - 09:45)

There are adverse effect of mindless YouTube autoplay, plethora of article are support that too. Although there are not many research conducted but  certainly this is evident that YouTube recommendation can be detrimental to time and life too.

Whoever reading this article has some form of knowledge what I am taking about. Maybe some people addicted to different social media so on so forth. 

So what I did is simple, just make it more intentional to search something on YouTube and hide all the recommendation. 

I use unlock origin for this purpose:

So what should we do to make my YouTube experience more intentional!

Install uBlock origin prerequisite chrome/firefox.
By using -> element picker mode -> pick the part of the YouTube you want to block like opening page, side quick toggle so on. 

Even I block the recommendation while playing video also, if you go beyond you can pick and globalise the blocking of thumbnail, comments, like-dislike button also 

Surprisingly that is worked for me because it is now more intentional rather than going into the rabbit hole of YouTube. 


What we learned?

Make things intentional, maybe automation is good for programming not for human. Human life and their choices shouldn’t be automated but flourish with choices and intentionality.  



P.S. 
Pro tip - enable unlock origin on incognito/private browsing also

My filters (uBlock Origin):
